## 1: Q-Learning

This code implements the Q-Learning algorithm for reinforcement learning. It uses a reward table (R) and a Q-table to find the optimal actions for navigating a 6x6 state space. The program updates Q-values over multiple episodes based on rewards and future state estimates.


## 2: Packman Heuristic Calculator

This code simulates a simple Pac-Man environment using a predefined 2D grid representing the game state. It calculates two heuristics: the number of pills (2s) remaining and the Manhattan distance to the nearest ghost (3s) from Pac-Man's position (fixed at `(5,7)`). The program prints the grid state and heuristic values.


## 3: Genetic Algorithm

The code implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve a problem of finding the best sequence of movements on a 3x3 grid, where the grid starts in a specific state (GA) and is aimed to reach a target goal state (Target_Goal).
